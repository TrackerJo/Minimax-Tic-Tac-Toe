# Minimax Tic Tac Toe

Play tic tac toe against an AI that uses the minimax algorithm. This project was created so I could better understand how the minimax algorithm works. I followed along with this article: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/finding-optimal-move-in-tic-tac-toe-using-minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory/
